## When Success Looks Like Suffering

Your teenager is getting straight A's. They're in honors classes, on the debate team, practicing piano two hours a day. From the outside, they're thriving.

But behind closed doors, they're crying over a 94% that "should have been" a 98. They're staying up until 2am rewriting an essay that was already excellent. They're having panic attacks before tests. They won't try out for the play because they "might not get the lead."

They look successful. But they're drowning in a sea of "shoulds."

As a therapist who works with anxious teens in Boise, I see this pattern constantly: high-achieving students whose perfectionism has crossed the line from motivation into anxiety that's stealing their joy, their sleep, and their mental health.

And often, parents don't realize there's a problem until their teen is in crisis.

## The "Should" Spiral

Perfectionism isn't about having high standards or working hard. It's about tying your entire worth to achievement and being terrified of falling short.

Listen for these phrases from your teen:

"I **should** be able to get all A's."
"I **should** make the varsity team."
"I **should** know this already."
"I **should** be better at this."

That word—should—carries so much weight. It's not "I want to" or "I'm working toward." It's a rigid expectation that leaves no room for being human.

When teens live in "should," everything becomes a test of their worth. And any mistake, any imperfection, any setback becomes proof that they're not good enough.

That's not healthy motivation. That's anxiety wearing an achievement ribbon.

## What Perfectionist Anxiety Looks Like in Teens

Perfectionism-driven anxiety doesn't always look like stress. Sometimes it looks like success—until you look closer.

**Paralysis over imperfection.** Your teen won't start the project because they're terrified it won't be perfect. Procrastination isn't laziness here—it's fear. If they don't try, they can't fail.

**All-or-nothing thinking.** A 92% feels like failure. Second place feels like last place. There's no middle ground, no "good enough." It's perfect or it's worthless.

**Never feeling "done."** They rewrite assignments over and over. They study until they're exhausted because they "should" know more. Nothing ever feels finished or good enough to turn in.

**Avoiding challenges.** Perfectionist teens often stick to what they know they can ace and avoid anything where they might struggle. They'd rather not try than risk not being the best.

**Physical anxiety symptoms.** Stomachaches before school. Headaches during test week. Trouble sleeping because their brain won't stop replaying what they "should have done better."

**Emotional breakdowns over "small" things.** A single point off on a quiz triggers tears or rage. These aren't overreactions—they're the overflow of constant internal pressure.

**Social withdrawal.** They cancel plans to study. They don't hang out with friends because they "should" be working. Relationships take a backseat to achievement.

**Harsh self-criticism.** The way they talk to themselves would horrify you. "I'm so stupid." "I'm a failure." "I'm not good enough." They'd never talk to a friend that way, but they say it to themselves constantly.

## Where Does This Come From?

Here's the hard truth for parents: sometimes, we contribute to it without meaning to.

I'm not blaming you. Most parents who raise perfectionist kids are loving, well-meaning people who genuinely want the best for their children. But certain messages—even positive ones—can feed perfectionism.

**"You're so smart!"** focuses on identity (who they are) rather than effort (what they did). When smart becomes their identity, anything less than perfect feels like proof they're not actually smart.

**"I know you can do better"** when they bring home a good grade can send the message that good is never enough.

**Our own anxiety about their future.** When we stress about college admissions, scholarships, or "falling behind," teens absorb that pressure and make it their own.

**Praise only for achievement.** If the biggest celebrations are for A's and wins, teens learn their worth is tied to performance.

**Our own perfectionism.** Kids watch how we treat ourselves. If we're constantly criticizing our own mistakes or working ourselves to exhaustion, they learn that's how life works.

None of this means you're a bad parent. It means we live in a culture that glorifies achievement and hustle, and sometimes those values seep into our homes without us noticing.

## The Cost of "Perfect"

Here's what perfectionism steals from teens:

**Joy in learning.** When everything is about the grade, curiosity dies. Learning becomes a performance, not an exploration.

**Resilience.** They never learn to bounce back from failure because they're terrified to fail in the first place. But resilience—learning to try again after messing up—is one of the most important life skills.

**Self-worth.** When your value is tied to achievement, you're always one bad grade away from feeling worthless.

**Mental health.** Perfectionism is strongly linked to anxiety, depression, and even eating disorders. The pressure doesn't just stress them out—it can make them sick.

**Connection.** Relationships suffer when achievement always comes first. They miss out on friendships, family time, and just being a kid.

**Sleep and health.** Late nights studying, skipped meals, constant stress—perfectionism takes a physical toll.

## How to Help Your Perfectionist Teen

Shifting away from perfectionism isn't about lowering standards or telling your teen not to care. It's about separating their worth from their performance and teaching them that mistakes are part of growth, not proof of failure.

### 1. **Change how you praise**

Instead of: "You're so smart!"
Try: "I love how hard you worked on that."

Instead of: "Great job getting all A's!"
Try: "I'm proud of how you stuck with that tough subject even when it was frustrating."

Praise effort, strategies, persistence, and growth—not just outcomes.

### 2. **Normalize mistakes and failure**

Share your own mistakes openly. Not in a "when I was your age" lecture way, but in a real, vulnerable way.

"I messed up at work today and had to redo a whole project. It was frustrating, but I learned something."

Show them that failure isn't the end of the world. It's information.

### 3. **Challenge all-or-nothing thinking**

When your teen says, "I failed that test" (after getting a B):

"A B isn't a failure. What would it look like to see that as a decent grade instead of a disaster?"

Gently help them see the middle ground between perfect and terrible.

### 4. **Ask about feelings, not just grades**

Instead of: "How did you do on the test?"
Try: "How are you feeling about school this week?"

Show them you care about their well-being, not just their performance.

### 5. **Set boundaries around achievement pressure**

If they're up until midnight perfecting an assignment, it's okay to say:

"I know you want this to be great, but sleep is more important. You're turning it in at 10pm whether it's 'perfect' or not."

Sometimes teens need permission to stop striving.

### 6. **Model self-compassion**

Let them hear you talk kindly to yourself when you mess up.

"I burned dinner. Oh well, that's what takeout is for! We all have off days."

They're watching how you treat yourself. Show them grace.

### 7. **Encourage activities just for fun**

Help them find something they do purely because they enjoy it—not to win, not to build a resume, just for the joy of it.

Art. Hiking. Cooking. Gaming. Singing in the car. Something with no pressure, no performance, no judgment.

## When to Seek Professional Help

If your teen's perfectionism is causing:
- Frequent anxiety or panic attacks
- Depression or feelings of hopelessness
- Self-harm or suicidal thoughts
- Eating disorder behaviors (restricting food, over-exercising, body image obsession)
- Inability to function (can't turn in assignments, skips school, avoids all challenges)
- Persistent physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches, insomnia)

It's time to reach out to a therapist who specializes in teen anxiety.

Therapy can help your teen:
- Identify and challenge perfectionistic thought patterns
- Build self-compassion and separate their worth from achievement
- Develop healthy coping tools for anxiety
- Learn to tolerate discomfort and imperfection
- Rebuild joy in learning and life beyond grades

## They Don't Have to Be Perfect to Be Enough

I wish I could tell every perfectionist teen I work with: You are enough exactly as you are. Your worth isn't in your GPA or your trophies or how many AP classes you take. You are valuable because you exist, not because of what you achieve.

But that message is hard to believe when you've spent years tying your worth to performance.

So as parents, we have to show them—through how we talk to them, how we respond to their mistakes, how we treat ourselves, and what we celebrate.

We have to teach them that "good enough" is often actually great. That rest isn't laziness. That mistakes are how we learn. That their worth is inherent, not earned.

It's not about raising kids who don't care about achievement. It's about raising kids who achieve without sacrificing their mental health, their joy, or their sense of self-worth in the process.

If your high-achieving teen is struggling under the weight of "should," you're not alone—and neither are they. If you're ready to help your teen build a healthier relationship with achievement, I'd love to chat about how therapy can support your family.
