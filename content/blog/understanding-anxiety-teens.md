## It's More Common Than You Think

If your teenager seems more irritable than usual, is withdrawing from friends, or suddenly struggling in school, anxiety might be the underlying cause. As a therapist who has worked with adolescents for over 15 years, I've seen firsthand how anxiety shows up differently in teens compared to adults.

While adults might describe feeling worried or on edge, teens often express anxiety through irritability, avoidance, physical complaints like headaches or stomachaches, or changes in sleep patterns. Understanding these signs is the first step toward helping your teen.

## What Anxiety Looks Like in Teens

Every teenager is different, but here are some common signs that anxiety might be affecting your child:

**Behavioral changes** — avoiding social situations they used to enjoy, refusing to go to school, or becoming overly dependent on you for reassurance.

**Physical symptoms** — frequent headaches, stomachaches, difficulty sleeping, or changes in appetite. Teens often don't have the language to describe emotional distress, so it comes out physically.

**Academic shifts** — difficulty concentrating, procrastination that feels paralyzing rather than lazy, or perfectionism that prevents them from turning in work.

**Emotional intensity** — increased irritability, tearfulness, or emotional outbursts that seem disproportionate to the situation.

## How You Can Help at Home

The most powerful thing you can do is create an environment where your teen feels safe enough to be honest about what they're experiencing.

**Listen without fixing.** When your teen opens up, resist the urge to immediately solve the problem. Sometimes they just need to feel heard. Try saying, "That sounds really hard. I'm glad you told me."

**Validate their experience.** Anxiety can feel irrational, but the feelings are very real. Avoid phrases like "just don't worry about it" or "there's nothing to be afraid of." Instead, try "I can see this is really stressing you out."

**Model healthy coping.** Teens learn from watching you. Share your own strategies for managing stress — taking a walk, deep breathing, talking to someone you trust.

**Maintain routines.** Predictability helps anxious brains feel safer. Consistent sleep schedules, regular meals, and structured time can make a real difference.

## When to Seek Professional Support

If anxiety is interfering with your teen's daily life — their friendships, schoolwork, family relationships, or ability to enjoy things they used to love — it may be time to reach out to a therapist.

Therapy provides teens with a confidential space to explore their feelings and learn practical tools for managing anxiety. As a parent, you'll also gain strategies for supporting your teen at home.

There's no perfect time to reach out, and seeking help is a sign of strength — not weakness. If you're ready to take the next step, I'd love to chat about how I can help your family.
