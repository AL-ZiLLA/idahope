## The Hardest Question Every Parent of a Struggling Teen Faces

Your teenager is having a panic attack about going to school. Do you let them stay home, or insist they push through?

They forgot an important assignment—again. Do you email the teacher to ask for an extension, or let them face the consequence?

They're isolating in their room, refusing to see friends. Do you give them space, or force them to engage?

These moments feel impossible because the line between **supporting** your teen and **enabling** their struggles is razor-thin. And most parents I work with in Boise are terrified of getting it wrong.

Here's the truth: Love looks like both comfort *and* challenge. The question isn't whether to help—it's *how* to help in a way that builds resilience instead of dependency.

## What Supporting Actually Means

**Supporting** means standing beside your teen as they navigate difficulty—not removing the difficulty for them.

Think of it like teaching someone to swim. You don't throw them in the deep end alone, but you also don't hold them up the entire time. You stay close, offer guidance, and gradually let them do more of the work themselves.

Supporting might look like:
- Validating their feelings while still holding boundaries
- Offering tools and resources, not solutions
- Being present for the struggle without rescuing them from it
- Allowing natural consequences while providing emotional safety
- Celebrating effort, not just outcomes

**Supporting says:** "This is hard, and I believe you can handle hard things. I'm here if you need me."

## What Enabling Actually Looks Like

**Enabling**, on the other hand, means protecting your teen from discomfort in ways that ultimately keep them stuck.

It's doing *for* them what they need to learn to do *for themselves*. And here's the confusing part—it almost always comes from a place of deep love and the desperate desire to ease their pain.

Enabling might look like:
- Calling them in sick to avoid anxiety-provoking situations repeatedly
- Completing homework or projects for them "just this once" (that turns into a pattern)
- Making excuses for their behavior instead of holding them accountable
- Removing all sources of stress rather than helping them build coping skills
- Shielding them from the natural consequences of their choices

**Enabling says:** "You can't handle this, so I'll do it for you." (Even if that's not what we mean to communicate.)

## The Pattern Parents Miss

Here's what enabling often looks like in practice:

Your teen is anxious about a test, so you let them skip school. They feel relief in the moment. The anxiety eases.

But the next time there's a test? The anxiety is *worse*, because now they've learned that escape is the solution. So they want to stay home again. And again.

Before you know it, school refusal has become a pattern. The short-term relief has created a long-term problem.

Enabling feels like helping in the moment. But over time, it sends the message: *"You're not capable. You need me to function. The world is too much for you."*

Even when that's the opposite of what we want them to believe.

## How to Know Which One You're Doing

Ask yourself these questions:

**1. Am I doing something they could do themselves (even if imperfectly)?**
- Enabling: Doing their laundry because they "don't do it right"
- Supporting: Teaching them how, letting them learn through trial and error

**2. Is this solving a problem for them, or helping them learn to solve it themselves?**
- Enabling: Calling the teacher to fix a grade dispute
- Supporting: Role-playing how *they* can advocate for themselves, then letting them try

**3. Am I protecting them from temporary discomfort or long-term harm?**
- Enabling: Letting them quit every activity when it gets hard
- Supporting: Helping them work through challenges while honoring genuine red flags

**4. Is this choice building their confidence or their dependence?**
- Enabling: Writing their college essays
- Supporting: Brainstorming ideas together, editing their work, but letting them own it

**5. Am I acting out of their needs or my own anxiety?**
- This is the hardest one. Sometimes we enable because *we* can't tolerate seeing them struggle.

## When Support Looks Like Saying No

Sometimes the most supportive thing you can do is refuse to rescue.

**"I'm not writing that email to your teacher. But I'll sit with you while you write it."**

**"I know you're anxious about school. I also know you're capable of going. What can we do this morning to make it a little easier?"**

**"You're mad at me for not fixing this. I get it. I'm still not going to fix it, because I believe you can handle it."**

This doesn't mean being cold or dismissive. It means holding the boundary *while* offering emotional support.

You can validate feelings and still require action.
You can be empathetic and still hold them accountable.
You can love them fiercely and still let them struggle.

## The Trap of "Just This Once"

"I'll just do it this one time."

Every parent says this. And sometimes, truly, "just this once" is fine.

But if you find yourself saying it repeatedly, you've crossed into enabling.

The pattern usually looks like this:
1. Crisis happens
2. You step in "just this once"
3. Relief (for both of you)
4. Crisis happens again (often bigger)
5. You step in again
6. Repeat

Before long, they've learned that crises get them rescued. And you've become the solution to problems they need to learn to solve.

## When Letting Them Struggle Is Actually Love

I know how hard it is to watch your teen fail. Miss a deadline. Lose a friend. Face a consequence.

Your every instinct screams to step in and make it better.

But here's what I've seen in my years working with teens: The ones who grow the most are the ones whose parents let them fall—*while staying close enough to help them get back up.*

Struggle builds resilience. Failure teaches problem-solving. Consequences create accountability.

**Your job isn't to prevent them from ever feeling pain. It's to teach them they can survive it.**

## What to Do Instead of Enabling

**1. Validate first, problem-solve second**

"I can see you're really overwhelmed by this project."
(Pause. Let them feel heard.)
"What do you think your first step could be?"

**2. Offer tools, not solutions**

Instead of: "Here, I'll call your teacher."
Try: "What are some ways you could approach your teacher about this?"

**3. Natural consequences > rescuing**

If they forget lunch, they're hungry. (Not fun, but not dangerous.)
If they procrastinate, they pull an all-nighter. (Exhausting, but instructive.)
If they don't study, they get a bad grade. (Disappointing, but survivable.)

Let the lesson happen.

**4. Support the process, not the outcome**

"I'm proud of you for studying, even though the grade wasn't what you hoped."
"You showed up even though you were anxious. That took courage."

**5. Be a consultant, not a manager**

Available for advice when asked. Not running the show.

## When to Absolutely Step In

There are times when stepping in isn't enabling—it's necessary.

**Do intervene when:**
- Their safety is at risk (self-harm, substance abuse, dangerous situations)
- They're being bullied or abused
- A mental health crisis is beyond their capacity to manage alone
- They're asking for help (not rescue, but genuine support)
- They've tried and truly cannot do it alone yet

The difference? You're removing a barrier they genuinely can't overcome yet—not one they just don't want to face.

## It's Okay to Get It Wrong Sometimes

You're going to step in when you should've stepped back.
You're going to hold a boundary when maybe you should've bent.
You're going to second-guess yourself constantly.

That's okay. Parenting isn't about perfection—it's about course-correcting.

If you realize you've been enabling, you can change the pattern. It won't be easy (they'll push back), but it's not too late.

**"I realize I've been doing too much for you. I'm going to start stepping back so you can build these skills yourself. It's going to feel hard at first, but I believe you can do it."**

And then hold the line. With love.

## The Long Game

Supporting instead of enabling doesn't mean they'll thank you in the moment. In fact, they'll probably be mad at you.

But years from now, when they're navigating their own challenges, they'll have the confidence that comes from knowing:

*I can handle hard things.*
*I've done it before.*
*My parents believed I could, even when I didn't.*

That's the gift you give them when you support instead of enable.

It's not the easy road. But it's the one that leads to resilient, capable, confident adults.
