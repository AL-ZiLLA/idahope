## When Stress Takes Over

We've all had those moments — your heart is racing, your thoughts are spiraling, and it feels like everything is too much. Whether it's a tough conversation, a demanding workday, or just the accumulated weight of daily life, stress has a way of pulling us out of the present moment and into a state of overwhelm.

The good news is that your body has a built-in system for calming itself down. Grounding techniques work by activating your parasympathetic nervous system — the part of your brain responsible for rest and recovery. With practice, these tools can help you move from fight-or-flight back to a place of calm in just a few minutes.

Here are five of my favorites that you can use anywhere, anytime.

## 1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Technique

This is one of the most effective grounding exercises because it engages all five senses, pulling your attention out of your head and into your immediate environment.

**How to do it:** Pause and notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.

Take your time with each one. The goal isn't to rush through the list — it's to truly notice what's around you. By the time you finish, you'll likely feel more present and less caught up in anxious thoughts.

## 2. Box Breathing

Used by Navy SEALs and first responders, box breathing is a simple technique that regulates your nervous system through controlled breath patterns.

**How to do it:** Breathe in for four counts, hold for four counts, breathe out for four counts, and hold again for four counts. Repeat this cycle four to six times.

The key is the hold. Holding your breath briefly signals to your brain that you're safe — if you were truly in danger, you wouldn't be able to pause like this. It's a small but powerful reset.

## 3. Cold Water Reset

When anxiety or stress feels intense, temperature change can interrupt the stress response quickly. This technique activates your body's dive reflex, which naturally slows your heart rate.

**How to do it:** Run cold water over your wrists for 30 seconds, hold an ice cube in your hand, or splash cold water on your face. If you're at home, you can press a cold washcloth against the back of your neck.

This one is especially helpful for moments of acute stress — before a presentation, after a difficult phone call, or when you feel a wave of panic rising.

## 4. The Body Scan

Stress often lives in the body before we're consciously aware of it. A quick body scan helps you locate and release physical tension.

**How to do it:** Starting from the top of your head, slowly move your attention down through your body — forehead, jaw, shoulders, chest, stomach, hands, legs, feet. At each point, notice if you're holding tension and consciously soften that area.

Most people are surprised by how much tension they carry without realizing it. Your jaw and shoulders are common culprits. Even just unclenching your jaw can create a noticeable shift in how you feel.

## 5. The Feet on the Floor Technique

This is the simplest grounding technique, and it's my go-to recommendation for clients who feel dissociated or "floaty" during stressful moments.

**How to do it:** Press your feet firmly into the ground. Notice the sensation — the pressure, the temperature, the texture of your shoes or the floor beneath you. Push down slightly and feel the solidity of the earth supporting you.

You can do this in a meeting, in the car, in a waiting room — anywhere. Nobody will know you're doing it, but you'll feel the difference.

## Making It a Practice

Grounding techniques work best when you practice them regularly, not just during moments of crisis. Try incorporating one or two into your daily routine — maybe box breathing before bed, or a quick body scan during your lunch break.

The more familiar these tools become, the more automatically you'll reach for them when stress shows up. Think of it like building a muscle — the more you practice in calm moments, the stronger your response will be when you really need it.

If you find that everyday stress feels unmanageable despite these techniques, that's not a failure — it's information. Sometimes stress and anxiety need more than self-help tools, and working with a therapist can help you understand the deeper patterns at play. I'm always here if you'd like to talk.
