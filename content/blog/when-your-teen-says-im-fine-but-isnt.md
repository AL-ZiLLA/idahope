## The Two Words Every Parent Knows Too Well

"How was school?"
"Fine."

"Everything okay?"
"I'm fine."

"You seem upset, want to talk?"
"I said I'm FINE."

If you're a parent of a teenager, you've been here. You can feel something is wrong—they're quieter than usual, withdrawn, maybe irritable—but when you ask, you hit a wall. "I'm fine" becomes their default answer to everything.

As a therapist who works with teens and their families in Boise, I can tell you this: when a teenager says "I'm fine" repeatedly, especially when their behavior tells a different story, they're rarely actually fine. They're often drowning—but they don't know how to say it, or they don't think you'll understand, or they're protecting you from worrying.

So how do you reach a teen who's locked behind those two words?

## Why Teens Say "I'm Fine" When They're Not

Before we can break through, it helps to understand what's really happening when your teen shuts down communication.

**They don't have the words yet.** Teenagers are still developing emotional vocabulary. They might feel overwhelmed, anxious, or depressed but lack the language to articulate it. "I'm fine" is easier than trying to explain something they don't fully understand themselves.

**They're protecting themselves.** If they've shared feelings before and felt dismissed, judged, or like you immediately tried to "fix" them, they learn it's safer to keep things inside. "I'm fine" becomes armor.

**They're protecting you.** Teens are more perceptive than we give them credit for. If they sense you're stressed or worried, they might hide their struggles to avoid adding to your plate.

**They're testing independence.** Part of adolescence is learning to handle things on their own. Sometimes "I'm fine" means "I want to figure this out myself" (even if they're struggling to do so).

**They genuinely think they should be fine.** Teens often minimize their own struggles. "Other people have it worse." "It's not a big deal." "I'm just being dramatic." So they say "I'm fine" because they think that's what they *should* be.

## What to Look for Beyond the Words

When your teen insists they're fine but your gut says otherwise, pay attention to these signals:

**Changes in behavior patterns.** Are they sleeping more or less? Eating differently? Spending way more time alone? Dropping activities they used to love?

**Mood shifts.** Increased irritability, tearfulness, numbness, or emotional outbursts that seem out of proportion.

**Social withdrawal.** Pulling away from friends, not going out anymore, always having an excuse not to do things.

**Academic changes.** Sudden grade drops, missing assignments, or school refusal can signal anxiety or depression.

**Physical complaints.** Frequent headaches, stomachaches, or just "not feeling good" without a clear medical cause.

Trust your instincts. You know your kid. If something feels off, it probably is—even if they say "I'm fine."

## How to Get Past "I'm Fine"

You can't force a teen to open up, but you can create conditions that make it more likely.

### 1. **Don't ask yes/no questions**

Instead of "Are you okay?" (which invites "I'm fine"), try:
- "What was the hardest part of your day?"
- "If you could change one thing about school right now, what would it be?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how stressed are you feeling this week?"

Open-ended questions are harder to shut down with two words.

### 2. **Try side-by-side conversations**

Direct eye contact can feel intense for teens. Some of the best conversations happen while doing something together—driving in the car, cooking dinner, walking the dog, shooting hoops.

There's something about not staring at each other that makes it easier to talk about hard things.

### 3. **Share your own struggles**

If you're always presenting a "fine" front too, your teen learns to do the same. Try sharing age-appropriate vulnerability:

"Work was really stressful today. I felt overwhelmed."
"I've been feeling anxious about [something]. It helps when I talk to someone."

This normalizes that it's okay not to be fine.

### 4. **Listen without jumping to fix it**

When your teen does crack the door open, resist the urge to immediately solve the problem. Teens often just need to be heard first.

Instead of:
"Here's what you should do..."

Try:
"That sounds really hard. Tell me more about that."
"I'm glad you told me. What would be helpful right now?"

Sometimes they just need to vent. Sometimes they need advice. Let them tell you which.

### 5. **Validate, don't minimize**

Even if their problem seems small to you, it's real to them.

Avoid:
- "That's not a big deal."
- "You'll get over it."
- "Just don't think about it."

Try instead:
- "I can see why that would be upsetting."
- "That makes sense that you'd feel that way."
- "Sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now."

Validation doesn't mean you agree with everything—it means you acknowledge their feelings are real.

### 6. **Give them other outlets**

Not every teen will talk to their parents (and that's developmentally normal). Make sure they have other trusted adults—a school counselor, coach, aunt, therapist.

Sometimes knowing they *can* talk to you is enough, even if they choose someone else.

## When "I'm Fine" Is a Red Flag

Most teens go through phases of being less communicative. But there are times when "I'm fine" combined with certain behaviors means you need to intervene, not wait.

**Seek professional help immediately if you notice:**
- Talk of self-harm, suicide, or feeling hopeless
- Significant changes in eating or sleeping (dramatic weight loss/gain, insomnia, or sleeping all the time)
- Risky or self-destructive behavior
- Complete social isolation for weeks
- Substance use
- Inability to function in daily life (can't get to school, withdraws from everything)

Don't wait for them to ask for help. If you're worried, reach out to a therapist who specializes in teens.

## You're Not Overreacting

I want to say this clearly: **If you're worried about your teen, you're not overreacting.**

Parents often second-guess themselves. "Maybe I'm being paranoid." "Maybe it's just a phase." "Maybe they really are fine and I'm making too much of this."

But here's the thing—you know your kid better than anyone. If your gut is telling you something is wrong, listen to it. It's always better to reach out and find out everything is okay than to wait and wish you'd acted sooner.

## Therapy Can Help

One of the most powerful things about therapy for teens is that it gives them a space that's entirely theirs. A place where they don't have to say "I'm fine." Where they can say "I'm struggling" or "I don't know" or "I'm scared" and have someone help them make sense of it.

Therapy also helps parents learn to communicate in ways that work for *their* specific teen. What works for one kid doesn't work for another. Together, we figure out what your teen needs to feel safe opening up—whether that's in session with me or at home with you.

## The Long Game

Breaking through "I'm fine" doesn't happen overnight. It takes patience, consistency, and a lot of showing up even when they push you away.

But keep trying. Keep checking in. Keep creating those side-by-side moments. Keep showing them that you're a safe place to land, even when they're not ready to talk yet.

Because eventually, when they are ready, they'll remember that you kept showing up. And that might be exactly what gives them the courage to finally say what's really going on.
