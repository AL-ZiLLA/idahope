## It's Not Always About Weight

When most people think of eating disorders, they picture extreme cases. But disordered eating exists on a wide spectrum, and it affects far more people than statistics suggest. Many of my clients don't realize their relationship with food has become unhealthy until the patterns have been part of their daily life for years.

The truth is, you don't need a formal diagnosis to deserve support. If food takes up more mental space than it should — if meals bring anxiety instead of nourishment — that's worth paying attention to.

## Signs Your Relationship with Food May Need Attention

Disordered eating doesn't always look the way we expect. Here are some patterns I frequently see in my practice:

**Rigid food rules** — labeling foods as "good" or "bad," following strict eating schedules, or feeling intense guilt after eating something "off plan." What starts as healthy eating can quietly become inflexible and controlling.

**Emotional eating cycles** — using food to cope with stress, loneliness, or boredom, followed by shame or frustration. This isn't a lack of willpower — it's a signal that emotional needs aren't being met.

**Preoccupation with body image** — constantly checking your appearance, avoiding mirrors or photos, or letting how your body looks determine how your day goes. When your sense of self-worth is tied to your body, everything else feels unstable.

**Withdrawal from social eating** — avoiding restaurants, family dinners, or gatherings where food is involved. If food-related situations trigger anxiety, isolation often follows.

**Compensatory behaviors** — exercising to "earn" or "burn off" food, skipping meals after eating more than planned, or other patterns aimed at undoing what feels like a mistake.

## Why These Patterns Develop

There's rarely a single cause. Disordered eating often develops from a combination of factors — cultural messages about body ideals, family dynamics around food, past trauma, perfectionism, or a need for control during times of uncertainty.

Understanding the root isn't about placing blame. It's about recognizing that your relationship with food is connected to deeper emotional needs, and those needs deserve compassionate attention.

## What Healing Looks Like

Recovery from disordered eating isn't about following a new meal plan or finding the "right" way to eat. It's about rebuilding trust — with your body, with food, and with yourself.

In therapy, we work together to understand the emotional function that food patterns serve, develop healthier coping strategies, and gradually challenge the beliefs that keep you stuck. Healing isn't linear, and there's no timeline you need to follow.

**It starts with honesty.** Being able to say "this isn't working" — even just to yourself — is a powerful first step.

**It grows with support.** You don't have to figure this out alone. Having someone in your corner who understands the complexity of eating disorders makes a real difference.

**It deepens with self-compassion.** Learning to treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a friend is often the hardest and most transformative part of the process.

## When to Reach Out

If your relationship with food is causing distress, affecting your relationships, or limiting your ability to live fully, it may be time to talk to someone. You don't need to be in crisis to ask for help — and early support can prevent patterns from becoming more entrenched.

I specialize in working with individuals navigating eating disorders and body image concerns, and I'd be honored to support you on your path toward a healthier, more peaceful relationship with food.
